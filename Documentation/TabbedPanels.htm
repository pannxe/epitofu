    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">How the tabbed dialog works</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      As previously, the main application page, for example, TwoByTwo.HTM, is
      partly an HTM file that the user customizes to specify the shape of the
      data entry table, etc, and is partly written dynamically by the program
      when writeFrontEnd in AppHelper.js is called. Let\'s call the combined
      page, APP.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      APP contains either DIVs or Iframes called Panel1-Panel5 that are made
      visible or invisible when one of the tabs at the top of the page is
      clicked. Clicking the tab turns on the panel for that tab and turns off
      the others. If the panel is loaded from an HTML text string, it is a DIV.
      If an HTM file is loaded, the panel is an Iframe. The panels contain the
      following:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      Panel1 &ndash; The visible part of APP, the Start screen.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      Panel2 &ndash; The data entry table, constructed dynamically by loading
      Etable.htm
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      Panel3 &ndash; Results, output as an HTML string by the statistics
      contained in the application.js file(e.g., TwoByTwo.HTM), formatted by the
      other programs in Etable_Files.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      Panel4 &ndash; Help as a file called OpenEpiHelp.htm
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      DemoData &ndash; Demo, as a file containing data saved from the
      Application. This file also contains results that are currently hidden.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
          None of the Application.js required changing for the new application;
          all of the statistical JavaScript files are unchanged.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
          Only two Application.htm files required changing to correct minor
          incompatibilities ( and ). There are no changes in the commands to
          generate data entry or output tables.
        </p>

          The language translation mechanism remains intact, although we will
          run update translation to catch any phrases that have changed.

          The only popup windows that appear are those for xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. The
          entire system is heavily dependent on JavaScript, and some users may
          have to adjust their browsers to allow scripting.

      How Demo Data Works
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      If the variable called DemoData contains a file name, such as
      TwoByTwoDemo.htm, the file is loaded into the DemoData iFrame when APP is
      loaded. It is not displayed because this iFrame refers to the CSS class,
      Panel, that keeps it hidden. A Demo button is included in the Start screen
      if the file exists.
